<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This plugin is relitivly easy to setup, despite being time-consuming. 

### Prerequisites

This repository was created for deployment on [Railway](https://railway.app/), and is the suggested hosting provider.
* Not endorsed by [Railway](https://railway.app/) or told to promote (But I still am because its really cool)

### Installation

**1.** Obtain a Discord bot token
  Visit the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and create a new application. Head into the "bot" tab, and click "Create a Bot", then copy the token. Input your token into the json string, found in your ``config-example.json``
  
  ```json
    "token": "your token here",
  ```

**2.** Copy & Paste the Guild ID, channels, and emotes, to make sure that every config entry is used.

**3.** Deploy however you wish, though I personally suggest [Railway](https://railway.app/), as it was designed for deployment.

**Railway Deployment**
Clone or fork this repository, then create a new project on [Railway](https://railway.app/), linking your newly created repository. Everything _should_ work as expected.
